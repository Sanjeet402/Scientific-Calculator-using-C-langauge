Subject: Request for Attendance Option – Ask Me Anything with Venkat Raghavan – [Your Name]

Dear [Department Head's Name],

I hope you are doing well.

I am writing regarding the upcoming session, Ask Me Anything with Venkat Raghavan. I have a pre-planned family function and will be in my hometown around that time. However, I’m very interested in attending and wanted to check if there will be an option to join online.

If not, I’ll make the necessary arrangements to attend in person instead.

Thank you very much for your understanding and consideration.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
